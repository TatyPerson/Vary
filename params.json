{"name":"Vary","tagline":"Environment based on Eclipse IDE for improving computer programming learning. This environment allows user to program algorithms in a pseudocode way and automatically transform them into a executable code in several languages, such as C or C++. It also allows the measurement of quality of the algorithms from the SonarQube platform.","body":"### **Complete pseudocode and of \"reference\"**\r\n\r\nSupports writing algorithms using the syntax described in the literature reference (Hurtado, 2002) of the subjects \"Introducción a la programación\" and \"Metodología de la programación\" in the UCA (Universidad de Cádiz).\r\n\r\n### **Multi-platform**\r\n\r\nBased on the popular Eclipse environment and available to Windows, Linux and Mac OS.\r\n\r\n### **Friendly environment**\r\n\r\nWizards, templates, autocomplete, formatting and automatic colored, quick fixes, outline view, etc.\r\n\r\n### **Multi-language syntax**\r\n\r\nAlgorithms can be programmed in Spanish and English, according to the user's preference when it begin to create a new project of code.\r\n\r\n### **Compiling and running**\r\n\r\nValidation and automatic C or C ++ code generation executable on the environment itself.\r\n\r\n### **Integrable**\r\n\r\nStatic code analysis of algorithms from the SonarQube environment.\r\n\r\n### **Extensible**\r\n\r\nDesign devised for adding new languages to the concrete syntax of language and new languages for code generation.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
